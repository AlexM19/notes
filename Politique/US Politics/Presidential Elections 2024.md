**Why the democratic party lost the 2024 election (claims and opinions)**

**Why GenZ are more conservative:**

Claims:

- The Left and the democratic party ignored (white?) men problems. Even worst they shunt them.
- There is no credible role model on the left.
- (White?) Men are less represented in video games and other media.
- Decreased beauty standard in mainstream media (video games, tv shows and movies) alienated young men's.
- Young women are less open for (sexual?) relationship. Their standard and expectation are too high for average men.

**The current (2024) US economy is bad?:**

Claims:

- Biden/Harris administration is responsible for the inflation.
- Biden/Harris did nothing to help the US economy.
- The average US citizen purchasing power decreased since the Biden/Harris administration.
- The US is not _drilling_ enough.
- The US is not manufacturing enough.
- The US economy is too entangle with the rest of the world. Need to be more isolationist (see Trump Tariffs proposal)
- Too much money was sent to Ukraine instead of being invested in US.

**The border and immigration issues:**

Claims:

- Most of the immigrant are illegals.
- A non-negligible number of them are criminal.
- Harris was responsible for the borders and did nothing.
- The border is _open_.
- The democratic party are directly responsible for the influx of migrants because of their rhetoric and politics.

**The democratic party had run a bad campaign:**

Claims:

- Calling Trump fascist or Nazi was bad.
- Too much running defence for Israel.
- Was out of touch with the worker class (see Bernie's comments)
- The candidate (Harris) and the campaign was too align with the establishment (Cheney endorsement).
- Too nuanced on the economy, supposedly too out of touch because not enough acknowledgement of public perceived struggle.
- Not enough progressive policy, more of the statue quo.
- Not enough representation in alternative media (see BTC's comments).
- The democratic party should have make Biden a one terme president and choose another better candidat in the four years of his presidency.
- They should have had a primary when Biden step down instead of directly nomating Harris.

## Reddit stuff

### Why does there seem to be a disconnect between economist and the average Americans?

>The Federal Reserve put out the results of a survey this month that kind of gets at this. The short answer is that Americans generally think they themselves are doing at least okay and they think the overall economy is doing terribly; 72% think they're doing at least okay but only 22% think the economy is doing okay, in 2019 those numbers were 75% and 50%, respectively.

>If you dig a little deeper, there are signs of greater levels of dissatisfaction -- there was a large spike in people reporting doing worse financially than in the previous year (31% in 2023 vs 14% in 2014). Digging further, the thing people hate more than anything is inflation. This is the first period of high inflation in decades, so everything could be as simple as the fact that most people really, really hate inflation.

>There's some interesting research that people suffer from a sort of money illusion where, if they got a 8% raise and inflation was 4% they think if inflation was 0% they still would have gotten that 8% raise; my raise was my hard work and the inflation is a sign of bad policy. In reality, if inflation was 0%, that raise would have been 4%. That might explain why sentiment is so poor -- people feel like inflation is cheating them out of pay increases. Economists will not tend to take this same view.

>Another possible reason for the disconnect, is that Americans have views about the macroeconomy that are detached from reality. Per a poll condcucted by the Harris Poll, over half of Americans think the US is currently in a recession, that inflation is increasing, and that unemployment is at a 50 year high. None of these are correct.

### Is the United State economy in a bad state?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1aerpfi/is_the_united_states_economy_in_a_bad_state/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1aerpfi/is_the_united_states_economy_in_a_bad_state/)

>I guess it depends on what you consider "bad" about the US economy. There are a lot of things that aren't great -- high levels of inequality, a lot of poverty for how rich the country is, etc., but if you thought the 2019 economy was good, the economy today is about where it was in 2019, and a lot of the things that are bad today were also bad in 2019, when sentiment about the economy was much higher.

>Real wages are higher than pre-pandemic and at an all time high (in particular for lower wage workers), unemployment is about the same of around its all time low, poverty is about the same as it was in 2019, inflation is coming down to around where it was, income inequality is falling, the median household has more wealth and savings now.

>Housing is worse, gas is relatively cheaper, corporate profits as a percent of gross national income are back to 2019 levels, etc. Most stuff is better, some (very important) things like housing are worse.

>Really though, the US is a very big country and even during the best economic times somewhere around 40% of people will earn less money than they did the previous year, so it's always easy to find someone who isn't doing as well as they think they could, which obviously sucks, but isn't necessarily representative. It definitely gets compounded by the fact that negative news gets a lot more clicks.
